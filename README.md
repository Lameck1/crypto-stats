## About Project

"Crypto Stats" is a web application that keeps track of cryptocurrency statistics. This application presents a user with a list of cryptocurrencies sorted in the order of their current market prices. A user can then click on one of the currencies to be directed to a details page with more stats on that particular cryptocurrency.
This project uses [Coinstats API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5734027/RzZ6Hzr3?version=latest) which is a public REST API for information on cryptocurrencies.
